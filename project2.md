HTML PARSER
===============

-   **Class: CSCI 315 Data Structures**
-   **Grade: A**
-   **Language(s): C++** 
-   **Source Code Repository:** [packerfan81/HTML_PARSER](https://github.com/Packerfan81/Data-Structures/tree/master/project2)  
    (Please [email me](mailto:jeengelhardt@csustudent.net?subject=GitHub%20Access) to request access.)

## Project description

 This is a simple CLI program.  First it runs HTML webpages through a parser to determine if they are balanced.  After that the program determines how many individual webpages you can visit from each web page.  Then outputs that data to the command line.


## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd /project location
make run
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
