## Project description

**This program simulates a restaurant ordering experience, allowing users to:**

1. Choose a Restaurant:
   
    - Select from a list of available restaurants.
    - View previous customer reviews for the chosen restaurant (loaded from a text file).
    - Proceed directly to the menu without reviewing past comments.
   
2. Browse the Menu:
   
    Access the menu for the chosen restaurant (loaded from a separate text file).
    View available dishes and their descriptions.
   
3. Build Your Order:
   
    Select items from the menu to add them to your order.
    Add or remove items as needed.
   
4. Review and Pay:
   
    View a detailed receipt listing the chosen items and their prices.
    Add a tip (as a percentage) to the order total.
    Pay for the order using a simulated card payment.
   
5. Review and Rate (Optional):
   
    Review the chosen restaurant based on your experience.
    Submit a rating (numerical score) for the restaurant.
    The user's review and rating are stored in a text file for future reference by other users.


## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

## UI Design

1. Displays all of the menus in the terminal giving the user the option to select an option by
   entering the Selection Code.
2. User receives a prompt asking if they would like to view the reviews for the restaurant. If so, a
   new screen will be displaying reviews otherwise it will move on to displaying the menu Items.
3. The menu of the selected restaurant is displayed and items can be added by typing in the items
   number.
4. Displays receipt and asks if user wants to continue to payment or cancel.
5. Payment information and additional confirmation.
6. Option to add review, and thank you credits.
