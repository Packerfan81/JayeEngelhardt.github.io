## Project description


## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project location
make run
make small30
make medium30
make large30
make large50
make small100
make small-timings
make medium-timings
make large-timings

```
Each command will run different data sets and output the time it takes to calculate the minimum overlap.  The commands with timings in the command will generate a graph also.
